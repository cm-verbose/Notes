# Comments
Comments in Python have no real usage in the functioning of the script. They are most useful in the debugging of the script, by indicating what certain parts of code do within the program. We can this use comments like this. Comments can usually be found under two forms, a single line and a multi-line comment (although improvised).

- A single line comment is declared with the **`#`** sign: 
  ```py
  # This is a comment 
  print("This is valid Python")
  ```
  
- A multi-line comment is declared with the **`'''`** or **`"""`** multi-line strings, but unassigned : 
  ```py
  """This
     is a 
     multi
     line
     comment
  """

  '''This
     is a 
     multi
     line
     comment
      too
  '''
  print("This is valid Python")
  ```

# Arithmetic operations 
Arithmetic operations are operations that have effect on numbers. Many of these operators, we already know, such as **addition**, **substraction**, **multiplication** * **division** and so on. In Python, there are these same operators that we can use on numbers. Here is a list of them. 

- ## Addition
  The addition operator `+` can be used to add 2 numbers. Be careful with it, because it can also concatenate two strings. 
  ```py
  ans = 10 + 9 
  print(ans) # 19 
  ```
- ## Substraction
  The substraction operator `-` can be used to substract 2 numbers. 
  ```py
  ans = 9 - 10
  print(ans) # -1 
  ```
- ## Multiplication
  The mutliplication operator `*` can be used to multiply 2 numbers. 
  ```py
  ans = 9 * 10
  print(ans) # 90
  ```
- ## Division 
  The divion operator `/` divides two numbers. 
  ```py
  ans = 8/9
  print(ans) # 0.8888888888888888
  ```
  
- ## Floor division 
  The floor division operator `//` divides the number and then floors it. Thus `1//2` is equivalent to `floor(1/2)`. 
  ```py
  ans = 30 // 9 # 3
  print(ans)
  ```
 
- ## Exponentiation
  The exponentiation operator `**` raises a value `x` to a value `y` giving thus x<sup>y</sup>. 
  ```py
    ans = 5 ** 5 # 3125
    print(ans)
  ```

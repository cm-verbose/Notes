# Variables
Variables in any language, including Python is a way of storing a value at a point in the memory of the program. It can later be called and used anywhere else in the program by writing it's name. Basic types of variables include : 

  - **`int`** or Integers are numbers with no decimal points. eg : (**`12`, `3`, `589`**).
  - **`float`** or Floating point numbers are numbers with decimals points. eg : (**`3.14`, `2,71`, `6.28`**).
  - **`str`** or String are strings of text. eg : (`"Hello World !"`, `'apple'`). They can both use the **single quote** (`'`) or **double quote** (`"`) to signify a string, as long as you are using the same quotation mark.  
  - **`bool`** or Boolean are equivalent to the English of **"yes" and "no"**, only in this context, it is **`True` and `False`**. 

Variable can change values if you re-assign them. For example : 

```py
x = "A"
x = True 
print(x) # True (because we re-assigned the first value "A" to True)
```

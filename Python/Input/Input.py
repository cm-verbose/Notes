# Single inputs

name = input("What is your name ? \n") # here \n is a newline, so it puts the cursor at the next line
print("Hi " + name + " !") # if you had entered a name here, it will print out "Hi John", if you would have typed "J


# Using multiple inputs

name = input("What is your name ? \n")
age = input("What is your age ? \n")
print("Hi " + name + " you are " + age + " years old") 
# Returns both the age and name, for example if name = "John" and age = "22", it will return "Hi John you are 22 years old"

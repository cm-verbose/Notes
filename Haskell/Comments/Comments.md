# Comments 
A comment is text that allows developers to **indicate what their code is doing**. In Haskell, these comments have **no interraction with the output of the script**, they just indicate **what the code is doing**. There are two types of comments introduced here : 

- Single line comments `--` : Used for representing single line comments (cannot have multiple lines) :
  ```hs
  -- This is a single line
  ```
- Double line comments `{- -}` : Used for representing double line comments (which can have multiple lines) : 
  ```hs
  {- 
    this 
    is a
    multi-line
    comment
  -}
  ```
